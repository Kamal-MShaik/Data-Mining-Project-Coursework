# Retention of credit card customers
# **1.0 Introduction**
Predicting bank customer retention by implementing multiple models and use evaluation metrics to compare model performances.
Several competitors have entered into the bank industry and it is critical to banks to retain customers by improvising the services offered to them. Almost every provider has implicated new technologies from which they are able to offer customers easy way to save earnings or make transactions. Hence, it is very crucial decision to make by the executive officers to make changes in the OPs or extend their services to retain present customers or attract new ones. 

Customers typically search for a variety of characteristics in a bank service provider, including proximity, online services, transaction feasibility, account flexibility, rates, and policies, among others. Banks must keep an eye on their competitors' efforts to persuade clients to utilize their services in order to retain customers. As a result, decisions must be made in order to stay competitive; otherwise, they will soon begin to lose clients.

In order to keep track of customers, banks hire analysts to make reports by analysing customer data. The data will usually consist of details of both current and defaulted customers such as transaction details, services they are currently using, personal details such as details about the family, occupation, income and geographical details such as address etc. Data analysts work on the data by implementing algorithms, making predictions and generate reports which depict customer’s activities that are being carried out with the bank. These insights are important and help decision makers to take effective actions to improve retention rates. 

This project conducts the analysis and predict if a customer will retain or not depending on various factors available in the data.

There are 10128 records of customer in the data with 21 attributes with no null values in any record. Below image shows the cover description of the data.
	
# **3.0	Task description**

The objective of this project is to predict the retention label for the customer record. In the Attrition column, there are two class labels; ‘0’ indicates that the customer is currently using the service and ‘1’ indicates that customer has already stopped using the bank service. Using the attributes as mentioned above in the data description table, the class labels for output ‘Y’ is predicted. The goal of the project is to train four different classification models by finding out the best fit and compare the performances using several evaluation metrics.
